# HackDuke2018 - Paper Play

Project for the 2018 Code for Good Hackathon at Duke University. 

## Why?

Here at Duke, we have a whole host of world-class amenities, from sports facilities to research laboratories to spaces dedicated solely to the arts. Many people across the United States and the world, however, don't have the time or the money to do things we take for granted, like sitting down at a Piano and playing some music. Paper Play aims to address this problem by providing people with a low-cost Piano-alternative that requires only a smartphone, while still providing the tactile experience of a real Piano. 

## Built With

We used React-Native and Expo to design our mobile app, and the Expo camera API to process the live image stream.
